# Weather App by emilyresch

## Description/Use
In this weather app, users can enter the name of a city in the search bar and are presented with two options: one to see the current weather and one to see the future/5-day forecast. 
When current weather is clicked, the user is presented with the name of the city and the country, an icon that describes the weather, the temp (converted to F from Kelvin), humidity, wind speeds, etc. When future forecast is clicked, there is a list of the following 5 days' temperatures along with their icons. 

## Tech
This app uses the Open Weather API, for current weather and five-day forecast.

## WIP
New searched cities are appended to the weather sometimes rather than replaced. The layout of the website is a little strange as well so needs some review. Please check back soon!
