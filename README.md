In this weather app, users can enter the name of a city in the search bar and are presented with two options: one to see the current weather and one to see the future/5-day forecast. 
When current weather is clicked, the user is presented with the name of the city and the country, an icon that describes the weather, the temp (converted to F from Kelvin), humidity, wind speeds, etc. When future forecast is clicked, there is a list of the following 5 days' temperatures along with their icons. 


Some issues: when I tried to add a function that put the searched city as a button in "search history" this broke my code. 
I also couldn't get the current/future buttons to appear at the top of their div (I tried a lot of things so I need a new pair of eyes on it). 
I need to finish up with local storage. 
UV index was not included in the object...

This time around I took a bunch of time to pseudo code and prepare for what was involved in this project. So, I have a good idea of where everything needs to happen but not entirely sure how to execute.
